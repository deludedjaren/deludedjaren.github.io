(Answer: One sentence that ends with a question mark that could act like the title of your data story),\nIs gender equality getting worse in India?\n\n\nWhy is this an important question? (Answer: 3 sentences, each of which has some evidence, e.g., “According to the United Nations…” to justify why the question you have chosen is important),\nThe question of whether gender equality is getting worse in India is significant due to several compelling reasons. According to the United Nations’ Human Development Index, India’s Gender Inequality Index (GII) ranks it as one of the countries with persistent gender disparities. India’s GII, according to the 2020 Human Development Report, stood at 0.501, indicating substantial gender inequality. Furthermore, evidence from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) shows that despite improvements in some areas, India still grapples with gender-based issues like maternal mortality, child marriage, and violence against women, underscoring the need to assess whether the situation is improving or deteriorating. Lastly, tracking changes in gender equality in India is vital as it can inform policy and program development to address disparities and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\n\nWhich rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question? (Answer: Actual names of the variables in the dataset that you plan to use).\nI currently intend to utilize all my variables to create a story on how gender inequality is evolving in India."

How will it answer your larger question?),\nThe main variables that I will likely focus on will be labor force participation rate for females and males.\n\n\n2. How do you plan to make it interactive? (Answer: features of ggplot2/shiny/markdown do you plan to use to make the story interactive) ,\nTry to use Shiny, although I am not very sure how to do so.\n\n\n3. What concepts incorporated in your project were taught in the course and which ones were self-learnt? (Answer: Create a table with topics in one column and Weeks in the other to indicate which concept taught in which week is being used. Leave the entry of the Week column empty for self-learnt concepts)\nI will update this as my website develops\n\n\nInclude the challenges and errors that you faced and how you overcame them.\nI struggle to incorporate Shiny into my website."

(Answer: 3 sentences, each of which has some evidence, e.g., “According to the United Nations…” to justify why the question you have chosen is important),\nThe question of whether gender equality is getting worse in India is significant due to several compelling reasons. According to the United Nations’ Human Development Index, India’s Gender Inequality Index (GII) ranks it as one of the countries with persistent gender disparities. India’s GII, according to the 2020 Human Development Report, stood at 0.501, indicating substantial gender inequality. Furthermore, evidence from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) shows that despite improvements in some areas, India still grapples with gender-based issues like maternal mortality, child marriage, and violence against women, underscoring the need to assess whether the situation is improving or deteriorating. Lastly, tracking changes in gender equality in India is vital as it can inform policy and program development to address disparities and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\n\nWhich rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question? (Answer: Actual names of the variables in the dataset that you plan to use).\nI currently intend to utilize all my variables to create a story on how gender inequality is evolving in India."
