    "text": "Final Submission\n\n1. What is the theme of your data story?\nThe theme of the data story revolves around assessing gender inequality in India by analyzing labor and educational statistics over time. The primary question addressed is whether gender equality is worsening in India, and key variables such as Female LFPR, Male LFPR, and educational levels are utilized to explore this theme. The story aims to shed light on disparities in occupational and economic opportunities, emphasizing the need to understand and address gender-based issues in the country.\n\n\n2. Why is it important to address this question?\nAddressing the question of whether gender equality is worsening in India is crucial for several reasons.\nFirst, global indicators such as the United Nations’ Human Development Index and the Gender Inequality Index highlight persistent gender disparities in the country. A high Gender Inequality Index (GII) score, as seen in India’s case, signifies substantial gender inequality.\nSecond, evidence from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) indicates that despite some improvements, India still faces challenges related to maternal mortality, child marriage, and violence against women. These factors influence educational and economic opportunities available to women. Understanding the trajectory of gender inequality is essential to identify areas for improvement and inform policy and program development.\nLastly, tracking changes in gender equality over time provides insights into societal progress and helps create a more inclusive and equitable environment. By addressing this question, the data story aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on gender equality and promote initiatives that can lead to positive changes in India’s social and economic landscape.\n\n\n3. Why do you think the data sources that you have curated can help you answer the question?\nThe curated data sources, obtained from the CEIC website, which compiles information from reliable sources like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and data.gov.in, provide a comprehensive and authoritative foundation for assessing gender inequality in India. Here’s why these sources are instrumental in answering the question:\nFirst, the data sources are credible and diverse. The CEIC website aggregates data from globally recognized institutions, ensuring the credibility and reliability of the information. By drawing from diverse sources, the data captures a holistic view of gender-related indicators, enriching the analysis.\nSecond, a longitudinal perspective is provided. The data sources offer a longitudinal perspective by including historical data. This allows for the examination of trends and changes over time, enabling a nuanced understanding of whether gender equality in India is improving or deteriorating.\nThird, a comprehensive range of indicators were included. The dataset includes crucial variables such as Female LFPR, Male LFPR, and educational levels, which are vital metrics for evaluating gender inequality in both economic and educational domains. This diversity of indicators enhances the depth and breadth of the analysis.\n\n\n4. What are the insights from the data and how are they depicted in plots?\nMy initial hypothesis going into this data experience was that gender inequality is worsening in India. My impression was formed by media sources which depicted how female labor involvement remained low even as India experienced significant economic growth. Through analysis of my data and visualizations, I drew the following insights:\nFirst, there is a general reduction in economic gap between genders. The data indicates a decreasing gap between Female LFPR (Labor Force Participation Rate) and Male LFPR, hence suggesting that the economic gap between males and females in India has generally reduced over time.\nSecond, there are increased educational and vocational opportunities for female youths. A larger proportion of female youths in India now have access to education, employment, or training. The gender gap in this regard has decreased from 43% in 1990 to 29% in 2022.\nThird, the educational gap between males and females has decreased. The educational gap between males and females has decreased from 56% in 2000 to less than 50% in 2022, this indicates that the average education level of a female worker has increased relative to a male worker.\nConsidering all of the above points, I would still conclude that there has been minimal improvement in gender inequality in India. While improvements have occurred, the overall progress in reducing gender inequality is considered minimal. The recent Global Gender Gap Index ranking India at 135 out of 146 countries underscores persistent challenges.\n\n\n5. How did you implement this entire project? Were there any new concepts that you learnt to implement some aspects of it?\nFirst, I utilized the CEIC website to collect secondary data from reputable sources like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and data.gov.in. This process provided me with understanding on how to navigate and extract relevant data from diverse sources. This is a valuable skill that involves assessing data reliability, relevance, and compatibility for analysis.\nSecond, I formulated the Key Question of whether gender equality is worsening in India. Developing a precise and relevant research question was essential for driving the focus of the project and aligning it with broader social issues.\nThird, I had to make decisions on which variables to include and exclude. I ended up choosinng key variables such as Female LFPR, Male LFPR, and educational indicators to answer the central question. The selection of variables required a strategic approach to ensure they effectively address the research question and provide meaningful insights.\nForth, I learnt how to create visualizations using ggplot2 to represent trends in labor force participation and educational disparities. Learning and implementing ggplot2 for data visualization involved understanding its syntax and capabilities, enhancing the storytelling aspect of the data.\nFifth, I learned how to create a website to present the data story, even though I struggled with design aesthetics and narrative coherence. Considerations behind my website design involved considering user experience, aesthetics, and creating a narrative flow that effectively communicates the key insights.\nWord Count (for final submission): 964 Words"

    "text": "Difference between Male and Female education levels over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHas Gender Inequality worsened?\nThrough analysis of data from 1990 to 2022, I cannot conclude that gender inequality has worsened over time. Whilst gender inequality remains an issue for India, the above data shows that the economic gap between males and females is reducing as the gap between female LFPR and male LFPR has generally reduced over time. Furthermore, a much larger proportion of female youths now have access to education, employment or training, with the gender gap decreasing from 43% in 1990 to 29% in 2022. Lastly, The average education level of the female worker has seen growth against the average male worker. The educational gap between males and females has decreased from 56% in 2000 to less than 50% in 2022. Whilst gender inequality has improved over time, the improvement can be considered to be minimal, with the gender gap still being very wide, as seen in the recent WEF report which ranked India at 135 out of 146 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index."
