(Answer: 3 sentences, each of which has some evidence, e.g., “According to the United Nations…” to justify why the question you have chosen is important),</h3>
<p>The question of whether gender equality is getting worse in India is significant due to several compelling reasons. According to the United Nations’ Human Development Index, India’s Gender Inequality Index (GII) ranks it as one of the countries with persistent gender disparities. India’s GII, according to the 2020 Human Development Report, stood at 0.501, indicating substantial gender inequality. Furthermore, evidence from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) shows that despite improvements in some areas, India still grapples with gender-based issues like maternal mortality, child marriage, and violence against women, underscoring the need to assess whether the situation is improving or deteriorating. Lastly, tracking changes in gender equality in India is vital as it can inform policy and program development to address disparities and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.</p>

<p>I am going to plot Male LFPR and Female LFPR against Time to show: (1) the stark difference between male and female LFPR and (2) how LFPR for both genders have changed over time in order to answer the question of whether or not gender inequality is worsening in terms of occupational and economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Next, I will plot the graph for proportion of females in labor force to show how female workers remain the minority over time in India, which can either be an indicator or cause of gender discrimination in India.</p>
<p>Lastly, I will plot the difference in educational levels between males and female workers to see how males have unfair access to education when compared to their female counterparts.</p>

<p>I will focus on using ggplot2 to create meaningful visualizations which can walk the user through the issue of gender inequality in India. I have made the decision not to incorporate shiny into my webpage as I feel that the plots generated are sufficient in answering the question of whether or not gender inequality is worsening in India.</p>

<p>I attempted to incorporate shiny into my webpage but was not successful. I managed to run the app in Rstudio but could not get it to work when I published it. After thorough consideration, I decided to move on without the use of shiny as I felt that it did not add significant value to my story.</p>

<p>Over W12, I attempted to plot ggplot2 graphs but struggled to do so for some variables due to the presence of NA values. I was not confident in tidying data in R before plotting it out. I sought help from Prof NV which allowed me to make progress as I was able to plot the graphs I wanted to answer the questions I had in mind.</p>
<p>That being said, given that this is the first time I am creating a website, I remained unsure on how to design it in a way that looks aesthetic. I also struggled to come up with a coherent story which conveyed the main issue that my website is trying to address. I am still in the process of coming up with questions which would allow me to answer the issue of how gender inequality has evolved over time in India.</p>
