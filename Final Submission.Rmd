## Week 9

### What is the topic that you have finalized?

This project aims to assess gender inequality in India by analysing labor and educational statistics over time.

### What are the data sources that you have curated so far?

I collected secondary data from the CEIC website, which is a website which compiles data sources from a myriad of reliable data sources such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, data.gov.in and more.

## Week 10

### What is the question that you are going to answer? (Answer: One sentence that ends with a question mark that could act like the title of your data story),

Is gender equality getting worse in India?

### Why is this an important question? (Answer: 3 sentences, each of which has some evidence, e.g., "According to the United Nations..." to justify why the question you have chosen is important),

The question of whether gender equality is getting worse in India is significant due to several compelling reasons. According to the United Nations' Human Development Index, India's Gender Inequality Index (GII) ranks it as one of the countries with persistent gender disparities. India's GII, according to the 2020 Human Development Report, stood at 0.501, indicating substantial gender inequality. Furthermore, evidence from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) shows that despite improvements in some areas, India still grapples with gender-based issues like maternal mortality, child marriage, and violence against women, underscoring the need to assess whether the situation is improving or deteriorating. Lastly, tracking changes in gender equality in India is vital as it can inform policy and program development to address disparities and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.

### Which rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question? (Answer: Actual names of the variables in the dataset that you plan to use).

I will use "Female.LFPR", "Male.LFPR", "MaleYouthNotInEET", "FemaleYouthNotInEET", "MaleLabourForceWithAdvancedEdu", "MaleLabourForceWithIntermediateEdu", "MaleLabourForceWithBasicEdu", "FemaleLabourForceWithAdvancedEdu", "FemaleLabourForceWithIntermediateEdu", "FemaleLabourForceWithBasicEdu".

## Week 11

### 1. List the visualizations that you are going to use in your project (Answer: What are the variables that you are going to plot? How will it answer your larger question?),

I am going to plot Male LFPR and Female LFPR against Time to show: (1) the stark difference between male and female LFPR and (2) how LFPR for both genders have changed over time in order to answer the question of whether or not gender inequality is worsening in terms of occupational and economic opportunities.

Next, I will plot the difference in educational levels between males and female workers to see how males have unfair access to education when compared to their female counterparts.

### 2. How do you plan to make it interactive? (Answer: features of ggplot2/shiny/markdown do you plan to use to make the story interactive) ,

I will focus on using ggplot2 to create meaningful visualizations which can walk the user through the issue of gender inequality in India. I have made the decision not to incorporate shiny into my webpage as I feel that the plots generated are sufficient in answering the question of whether or not gender inequality is worsening in India.

### 3. What concepts incorporated in your project were taught in the course and which ones were self-learnt? (Answer: Create a table with topics in one column and Weeks in the other to indicate which concept taught in which week is being used. Leave the entry of the Week column empty for self-learnt concepts)

| Week | Concept Used + How It Was Used                                                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | How to use Rstudio + Using Rmarkdown                                                  |
| 2    | Data visualization and use of ggplot2                                                 |
| 4    | Tidying my data to ensure that it works in ggplot2                                    |
| 7    | Creating meaningful visualizations. I mainly used geom_line to show change over time. |

### Include the challenges and errors that you faced and how you overcame them.

I attempted to incorporate shiny into my webpage but was not successful. I managed to run the app in Rstudio but could not get it to work when I published it. After thorough consideration, I decided to move on without the use of shiny as I felt that it did not add significant value to my story.

## Week 12

### Include the challenges and errors that you faced and how you overcame them.

Over W12, I attempted to plot ggplot2 graphs but struggled to do so for some variables due to the presence of NA values. I was not confident in tidying data in R before plotting it out. I sought help from Prof NV which allowed me to make progress as I was able to plot the graphs I wanted to answer the questions I had in mind.

That being said, given that this is the first time I am creating a website, I remained unsure on how to design it in a way that looks aesthetic. I also struggled to come up with a coherent story which conveyed the main issue that my website is trying to address. I am still in the process of coming up with questions which would allow me to answer the issue of how gender inequality has evolved over time in India.

## Final Submission

### 1. What is the theme of your data story?

### 2. Why is it important to address this question?

### 3. Why do you think the data sources that you have curated can help you answer the question?

### 4. What are the insights from the data and how are they depicted in plots?

### 5. How did you implement this entire project? Were there any new concepts that you learnt to implement some aspects of it?
